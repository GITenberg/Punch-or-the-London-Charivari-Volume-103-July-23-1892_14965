    <h2>FROM DAY TO DAY.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Study in Political Journalism, from some of the
    Morning Papers.</i>)</h4>

    <h4>No. I.</h4>

    <p>To-day, the first pollings of the General Election take
    place, and the electors will be called upon to decide one of
    the most momentous issues that have ever been submitted to the
    judgment of the country. For ourselves, we cannot doubt for a
    moment as to what the verdict will be. It is impossible that a
    policy of empty promises, backed by mere misrepresentation,
    should prevail against a glorious record of administrative,
    legislative, and financial success. Careful calculations have
    convinced us that those who now hold the reins of office will
    return to power with a largely increased majority, to continue
    their beneficent work. The country recognises by this time that
    anything short of that would mean disaster to the commonwealth.
    Even with a small majority, the forces of disorder would be
    able to work untold mischief. Such a result, however, is not
    within the bounds of possibility, seeing that the Election will
    be fought purely and simply on the Irish question, which has
    been placed fully before the electorate in all its bearings.
    Our organisation is perfect, and our triumph assured.</p>

    <h4>No. II. (<i>Three Days Later</i>.)</h4>

    <p>We are constrained to admit that, so far, the result of the
    Elections has not come up to the confident anticipations of our
    Party. Seats have been lost that ought to have been retained.
    On the other hand, we have failed to win seats that we had a
    right to count upon as certainties. It is not easy to apportion
    the responsibility for failure. Over-confidence and a
    consequent want of energy may have had something to do with it;
    but the chief reason is to be found in the disgracefully
    defective organisation of the Party. The story is an old one.
    We have ourselves deemed it our duty to lay this aspect of the
    case before the Leaders of the Party, but our repeated warnings
    have been unheeded, and the necessary consequences have
    followed. Our opponents, however, have not much to congratulate
    themselves upon. The Irish question has been kept studiously in
    the back-ground, and the results, so far as they have gone,
    only prove conclusively that there is no diminution whatever in
    the dislike with which the majority of the electorate regard
    the proposals of the party of disorder. We are far from saying
    that even now we shall lose the Election. Everything may yet be
    retrieved. But, even should the result be numerically
    favourable to the Opposition, they will be powerless for
    mischief with the small majority which is all they are likely
    to get.</p>

    <h4>No. III. (<i>A Week Later</i>.)</h4>

    <p>The Elections are now nearing an end, and it is possible to
    summarise the results. It is not surprising that our opponents
    should be reduced to the lowest depths of despair. They counted
    with the utmost certainty on a majority of two hundred. But, as
    matters stand, it is out of the question that their
    preponderance should exceed fifty. Where are now the confident
    boastings with which they inaugurated the campaign? They have
    confused the judgment of the electors with every kind of
    side-issue. Misrepresentations have been sown broadcast, and
    have, in too many instances, succeeded. But the great heart of
    the country is still sound. Votes must be weighed as well as
    counted, and it is safe to assume that, with a paltry and
    heterogeneous majority of merely fifty, the advocates of
    revolution will be reduced to impotence, even if they can
    succeed in forming a Government at all. The result is one on
    which our Party may well congratulate themselves. They have
    worked hard, and the solid fruit of their efforts is now within
    their reach. We may safely say that the Irish policy of our
    opponents has received its death-blow.</p>

    <h2>DUST AND HASHES.</h2>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;When I first took my present house, I was advised
    to get a Sanitary Dust-bin, instead of the old brick one which
    existed in my back-yard. One of the blessings predicted for my
    Sanitary Dust-bin, was, that it was "easily removable." I find
    this to be the case. It has already been removed by some
    area-sneak, and as I have got rid of the old brick dust-bin,
    the Vestry threaten to prosecute me for creating a nuisance,
    because my dust is now placed in a corner under my front steps.
    What am I to do?</p>

    <p class="author">AGGRIEVED HOUSEHOLDER.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;I find that the law recently passed against tips
    to Dustmen is quite unknown&mdash;at all events, to the Dustmen
    themselves. My servants, I find, go on freely bribing these
    functionaries, to remove bones and vegetable refuse. Their rate
    of tipping, as far as I can make out, is about a halfpenny per
    bone. If I were now to enforce the law and forbid tips, I
    foresee that the Dustcarts would have pressing business
    elsewhere, and would visit me about once a month. Then would
    follow a <i>régime</i> of "big, big, D.s"&mdash;in the
    window&mdash;which would be intolerable. I prefer tipping to
    typhoid.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours long sufferingly,<br />
    VICTIM OF THE VESTRIES.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;The Vestry is <i>quite right</i> to insist on
    every house burning up its own odds and ends. The <i>true</i>
    domestic motto is&mdash;"Every kitchen its own crematorium." I
    do this <i>habitually</i>, out of <i>public spirit</i>. It is
    true that a sickening odour permeates the house for an hour or
    two of every day, created by the combustion of dinner remnants;
    also that most of my family suffer from bad sore throats, which
    they attribute to this cause. What of that? The <i>truly good
    Citizen</i> will prefer to poison himself rather than his
    neighbours.</p>

    <p class="author">A CLERKENWELL CATO.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;I recently purchased <i>Dodger's Digest of
    Dustbin Law</i>, and recommend it to the perusal of every
    householder. In the case of <i>The Vestry of Shoreditch</i> v.
    <i>Grimes</i>, Lord Justice SLUSH remarks&mdash;"The Vestry
    complains that the Defendant's bin was improperly covered;
    that, in fact, it was not under coverture. To this the
    Defendant replies that his bin was void <i>ab initio</i>, as
    there was nothing in it. Then the question arises whether the
    Defendant's Cook was justified in tipping the Dustman into the
    empty bin, considering that the Legislature has distinctly
    forbidden tips of all kinds to Dustmen. I am of opinion that
    the Cook was the Defendant's agent, and that the rule of <i>qui
    facit per alium facit per se</i> applies here. The Cook's
    proceeding was undoubtedly tortious; it was not a criminal
    action, though it certainly cannot be called a civil one. I
    agree with my brother CHIPPY that the <i>ratio decidendi</i>
    must be, whether the Dustman, in coming to clean out an empty

    <h4>(<i>An Electioneering Reminiscence.</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>A narrow South London Street of
        two-storeyed houses, with a Rag-and-Bone Shop at one end
        and a Public House at the other. Time, about four o'clock
        on a warm Saturday afternoon. Enter</i> Mr. CARLTON-JERMYN,
        <i>a middle-aged gentleman, in faultless get-up, who, in a
        moment of weakness, has undertaken to canvass the district
        for his friend, the Conservative Candidate.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Mr. C.-J.</i> (<i>to himself, as he regards his
        surroundings with dismay, and tries to arrange his
        canvassing-cards</i>). I suppose this <i>is</i> Little Anna
        Maria Street? I didn't understand at the Committee Rooms
        that it was <i>quite</i> such a&mdash;however, I must do my
        best for dear old TILNEY. Who's the first man I must see
        and "use my best endeavours to persuade him into promising
        his vote?" Ah, Mr. J. SPLURGE, No. 1. (<i>He picks his way
        delicately along, attempting to make out the numbers on the
        doors, which are all thrown back; female residents watch
        him from doorsteps and windows with amused interest.</i>)
        No. 5; No. 3; the next is No. 1. (<i>It is; but the
        entrance is blocked by a small infant with a very dirty
        face, who is slung in a baby-chair between the
        door-posts.</i>) Very embarrassing, really! Can't ask such
        a child as this if Mr. SPLURGE is at home! I'll knock.
        (<i>Stretches for the knocker across the child, who,
        misinterpreting his intentions, sets up a howl.</i>) My
        good child, I assure you ... for Heaven's sake, don't!...
        I&mdash;I wonder whether I ought to <i>kiss</i>
        it&mdash;some fellows would!</p>

        <p><i>Female Voice</i> (<i>from side-window</i>). You leave
        that pore child alone, will yer&mdash;or I'll come out and
        <i>tork</i> to you, d'y'ear?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.-J.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). That's <i>Mrs.</i>
        SPLURGE! I think, perhaps, I'd better <i>not</i> wait.
        (<i>With an inspiration.</i>) I'll leave a card. (<i>Drops
        one of his visiting-cards in the child's lap&mdash;to its
        exceeding terror&mdash;and retreats.</i>) I'm <i>afraid</i>
        I haven't produced a very favourable impression, so far,
        I'll try No. 2, across the street. (<i>He approaches a
        doorstep upon which two stout and dishevelled Women are
        seated.</i>) Er&mdash;I <i>beg</i> your pardon, but could
        you kindly inform me if Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;(<i>consulting
        card</i>)&mdash;GUFFIN is at home?</p>

        <p><i>First Woman</i> (<i>with sarcasm</i>). Now <i>do</i>
        yer think he's nothink else to do but set indoors in a
        arm-cheer all day?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.-J.</i> I&mdash;I thought&mdash;I
        hoped&mdash;that, it being Saturday, I might
        be&mdash;er&mdash;fortunate enough&mdash;have I the
        pleasure of addressing Mrs. GUFFIN?</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Both Women are convulsed with uncontrollable
        mirth.</i></p>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Second Woman</i> (<i>on recovering&mdash;calling down
        the passage</i>). 'Ere, Mrs. GUFFIN, yer wanted. 'Ere's a
        gentleman come to see yer!</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Guffin</i> (<i>appearing from the basement, and
        standing at the further end of the passage</i>). Well, what
        does <i>he</i> want?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.-J.</i> (<i>raising his hat, and sending his
        voice down the passage to her</i>). I ventured to call,
        Mrs. GUFFIN, in the hope of finding your husband at home,
        and ascertaining his&mdash;er&mdash;political sympathies,
        in view of the Election.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Guffin.</i> Oh, it's about the voting, is it?
        Are you for a Conservatory?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.-J.</i> For a&mdash;? Oh, to be sure, yes. I
        came to ask Mr. GUFFIN to support Sir TILNEY BRUTON, the
        Conservative Candidate. Perhaps if I called again, I
        might&mdash;?</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Guffin</i> (<i>in a matter-of-fact tone</i>). I
        don't expect my 'usband 'ome till late, and then he'll be
        drunk.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.-J.</i> Just so. But I trust, Mrs. GUFFIN, your
        husband feels the importance of maintaining the
        Union&mdash;?</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Guffin.</i> He <i>did</i> belong, I know, but I
        think his branch broke up, or somethink.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.-J.</i> (<i>puzzled</i>). Ah, but I mean
        in&mdash;er&mdash;politics&mdash;I hope he is opposed to
        granting Home Rule to Ireland?</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. G.</i> He don't tell <i>me</i> nothing about his
        politics, but I've 'eard him say he was Radikil.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.-J.</i> (<i>diplomatically, as</i> Mrs. G.
        <i>slowly edges towards the door</i>). Might I suggest,
        Mrs. GUFFIN, that you should use
        the&mdash;er&mdash;influence which every woman possesses,
        to&mdash;er&mdash;induce your husband&mdash;(<i>here he
        suddenly becomes aware that</i> Mrs. GUFFIN <i>has a very
        pronounced black eye</i>); but perhaps I ought not to ask
        you.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. G.</i> Well, <i>my</i> opinion is&mdash;if you
        want someone to tork over my 'usband to your side, you'd
        better come and do it yourself; because <i>I</i> ain't
        goin' to. So there! [<i>She retires to the basement
        again.</i></p>

        <p><i>First Dish. W.</i> If you toffs can't do nothink
        better than come 'ere makin' mischief between a man and his
        wife, you'd better stop at 'ome, <i>that</i> you 'ad!</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.-J.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Upon my word, I
        believe she's right! But I never noticed the poor woman's
        eye before. I wish I could find one of the <i>men</i> in,
        and have a talk with him&mdash;much more satisfactory!
        (<i>Knocks at No. 4</i>) Is Mr. BULCHER at home?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. B.</i> (<i>lurching out of a room on the
        ground-floor</i>). Qui' c'rect, Guv'nor&mdash;thash me!</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.-J.</i> I wanted to see you, Mr. BULCHER, to
        ask if we may count upon your support for the Conservative
        Candidate at the Election. I need hardly point out to you
        the&mdash;er&mdash;vital importance of&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>Mr. B.</i> (<i>slouching against the passage-wall,
        opposite Mr. C.-J.</i>). 'Old on, Guv'nor, lemme ashk you
        thish question, 'fore we go any furrer. Wharriwanter 'ear
        from <i>you</i> is&mdash;'Ow 'm I goin' git little bit o'

        <p><i>Mr. C.-J.</i> But surely&mdash;er&mdash;it was a
        Conservative Government that gave you Free Education?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. B.</i> (<i>knowingly</i>). No, it washn't,
        Guv'nor. There yer wrong, d'yer see? It wash er
        <i>Radicals</i> give us Free Education. And whatsh Free
        Education er me? Wouldn' say Thank yer f'rall Free
        Education in er wide world!</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.-J.</i> (<i>recognising that he must strike a
        stronger chord</i>). Well, at all events you will admit
        that, during the last six years, you have
        been&mdash;er&mdash;peaceful and prosperous?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. B.</i> (<i>beerily</i>). I've been peashful and
        proshperous ever sinsh I was born. No, look 'ere, Guv'nr,
        I'm torken to you 'bout wharri <i>unnershtan'</i>, d'yer
        see? Jes' you lishen er wharri'm goin tell you. (<i>Here he
        punctuates his remarks by poking</i> Mr. C.-J.'s <i>ribs
        with a clay pipe.</i>) Workin' man's gettin' more and more
        'telligent every day&mdash;he'sh qui' capable lookin' after
        his own interests. What he wantch is, One Man One Vote,

        There you <i>'ave</i> it.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. C.-J.</i> But&mdash;er&mdash;don't you see, my
        friend, that, according to Mr. GLADSTONE, the more
        intelligent and educated you are, the more you're
        wrong?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. B.</i> Nothing of&mdash;er&mdash;kind. Don' you

        'pinions&mdash;my p'litical 'pinions, and the prinshiples I

        <p><i>Mr. C.-J.</i> In that case, Mr. BULCHER, I need not
        occupy your time any longer, so I'll say&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>Mr. B.</i> (<i>buttonholing him</i>). Don' you go

        incoherence</i>). I'm afraid he was not <i>quite</i> in a
        condition to be argued with, but perhaps I shall do better
        with Mr. MOLESKIN, next door. (<i>To a small boy in

    <p>"BEAR WITH US."&mdash;In the case reported in the papers
    last week of "an infuriated bear shot at Croydon," Inspector
    ORMONDE said that "when the ring had been removed from its lip,
    the animal was so much relieved that it immediately turned a
    somersault." A picture of this interesting incident should be
    at once painted and hung up in the Divorce Court. The husband,
    who has become quite a bear in consequence of his better half
    having rendered herself quite unbearable, would naturally turn
    head-over-heels with joy on getting quit of the ring. But alas!
    mark the end of the poor bear. He got more and more excited; he
    had to be looked up in a stable. Here the joy and novelty of
    the situation overcame him; his mighty brain gave way; he
    became mad as a hatter&mdash;(<i>Alice in Wonderland</i> might
    have asked, "Then why didn't they send for a hatter, who would
    have brought a chimney-pot, or some sort of a tile for his
    bear-head?")&mdash;and subsequently the veterinary Mr. THRALE
    (whose ancestral namesake had considerable experience in
    dealing with that learned bear. Dr. JOHNSON) procured a gun,
    and potted the bear. Awkward in his life, but grease-ful in his
    death.</p>

    <h2>LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.</h2>

    <p class="author"><i>Mount Street, Grosvenor Square.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>Anything more dreary than racing during this week's weather
    at Newmarket can scarcely be imagined! I have often heard Lord
    ARTHUR declare he was "as dry as a limekiln," and always
    thought it an absurd expression; and now I <i>know</i> it
    is!&mdash;for anything more <i>wet</i> than the Limekilns at
    Newmarket this week I never saw!&mdash;it's a mystery to me how
    the poor horses and men avoid catching cold, cantering about
    there without galoshes&mdash;though, by the way, Mr. HAMMOND
    had <i>one</i> "<i>Galoche</i>" which, of course, was not much
    use!</p>

    <p>Owing to the smallness (that's a good word) of the
    attendance, we were "pinched" a little in the prices, and of
    course the pinch came where one least expected it, which was
    somewhat disconcerting&mdash;but as most of the "good things"
    came off all right&mdash;(especially those we took with us from
    BENOIST and FORTNUM's)&mdash;it did not matter so much. Ladies
    of course were chiefly conspicuous by their absence, but my
    sweet friend Lady NEWMAN GATESHEAD was quite the <i>Belle</i>
    of the gathering, and attracted nearly as much attention as the
    <i>Queen of Navarre</i>, who naturally won her race in royal
    style!</p>

    <p>My selection for the Chesterfield Stakes, <i>Meddler</i>,
    was successful after a short struggle with the Duke of
    PORTLAND's <i>Kilmarnock</i> to whom he had to give five pounds
    (I hope this does not mean that the noble owner is in want of
    money!); but I am told the latter was not "fit" and "will do
    better with time!" though I don't quite see how that can be, as
    surely "time" travels faster than <i>Meddler</i>, so that,
    unless they take time with him, the handicap will be difficult
    to frame! By the way, when the handicaps <i>are</i> framed,
    where do they hang them up? and is it one of the "perks" of the
    Handicapper to supply the frames?</p>

    <p>Those who waited in the rain for the last race on Wednesday
    were rewarded with a splendid exhibition of horsemanship, given
    by WEBB on <i>St. Angelo</i>; who appears to be somewhat of a
    "handful" (<i>St. Angelo</i> I mean, not WEBB, who is very
    slight), and evinces a strong desire to run in any direction
    but the one desired of him! I think Mr. MILNER should have him
    trained on a zigzag method, when his natural wilfulness would
    cause him to run straight when racing! This is an excellent
    idea, and I have others equally good (applicable to all styles
    of horses), which I intend to suggest to different trainers on
    my next visit to Newmarket!</p>

    <p>We were all relieved when the "curtain rang down" on
    Thursday&mdash;(this is not, at first sight, a racing
    expression, but is largely used by sporting writers, as
    demonstrating the diversified nature of their knowledge!), in
    time for us to catch the early special for Liverpool Street;
    which, special, might really, from the major portion of its
    patrons, have been thought to be starting for Jerusalem!</p>

    <p>Friday was a glorious day for the Eclipse, which was only
    visible from the Observatory at Esher&mdash;the best account
    appears to have been given by Professor <i>Orme</i>, who
    recovered from his recent severe illness just in time to be
    present.</p>

    <p>Just a word in conclusion on the big race of next
    week&mdash;a paradox&mdash;be "wide awake" and go "nap" on my
    tip, from information privately given to</p>

    <p>A GOOD STAYER.&mdash;From the <i>Times</i> of Tuesday, the

    <p>"Seven years in a Turkish Bath!" As Mr. WILSON BARRETT would
    exclaim, "How long! How long!" What better example of patience
    and perseverance, which, as all know, are "good for the gout,"
    could possibly be given? That after this long stay in the
    Turkish Bath, he should be "a good invalid attendant," goes
    without saying. And not only is he "attentive," which is a
    great point in an "attendant," but he is also active&mdash;and
    this after so long a stay in a Turkish Bath, of which, however,
    he does not mention the temperature.</p>

    <h2>STUDIES IN THE NEW POETRY.</h2>

    <h3>No. IV.</h3>

    <p>In offering this fourth example of the New Poetry to his
    readers, <i>Mr. Punch</i> wishes it to be distinctly
    understood, that he is in no way responsible, personally, for
    the curious mixture of divinities and semi-divinities who
    figure in it. It is one of the distinguishing marks of this
    particular sort of New Poetry to pile up a confusion of more or
    less mythological names in a series of swinging and resonant
    lines. In one line the reader may imagine himself to be
    embarked in the River Cocytus. In the next, he will be
    surprised to find himself in Eden. Blood, battle,
    bumptiousness, and an aggressive violence, are special
    characteristics of this style of writing. Some of the lines
    apparently mean nothing at all, others are calculated to make
    timid people tremble; and the effect of the whole is generally
    picturesque, lurid, and uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>One of the great advantages of a poem like this, is that it
    may be used for all kinds of purposes. For example, if it was
    originally written as an invective against an opponent, it may
    afterwards, with the utmost ease, be made to serve as a
    threnody. Here then without further preface is:&mdash;</p>

            policeman riled;</p>

            <p>And BUDDHA made no remark at all, but nodded his
            heavy head,</p>

            <p>Like a boy who has eaten too much dessert, and wants

            back to a spot remote,</p>

            <p>And observed that they knew that this would come
            from letting the Masses vote.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Then AZRAEL spake&mdash;"On the Stygian lake I
            floated a half-sinned sin</p>

            <p>On the crest of a cross-grained stickleback, that is
            caught with a crooked pin;</p>

            <p>But the Flea flew free from the pincers' grip, and

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p><i>The Royal Agricultural Society's Journal</i>. A Society
    Journal of a peculiar character, of which this is the Third
    Series and Third Volume. It is noticeable for Lord CATHCART's
    appeal for the wild birds, which, as addressed to farmers and
    farm-labourers and armed ploughboys, may be summed up by an
    adaptation of the refrain of the remonstrance&mdash;so
    frequently urged by one of Lieutenant COLE's funny
    figures&mdash;"Can't you let the birds alone?" Then Mr. HASTING
    "On Vermin," which doesn't sound nice, though better than if
    the title were <i>vice versâ</i>,&mdash;is most interesting,
    especially where he tells us that "shrews are harmless." If so,
    why did SHAKSPEARE give us "<i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>" as
    such a feat? Professor BROWN writes about disease in sheep, of
    which paper Lord ARTHUR WEEDON DE GROSSMITH would be absolutely
    correct in observing, "What rot!" And, by the way, <i>à
    propos</i> of WEEDON, the Baron has to congratulate the
    Brothers GROSSMITH on their <i>Diary of a Nobody</i>,
    republished from <i>Mr. Punch's</i> pages, but with
    considerable additions. The Diary is very funny, not a page of
    it but affords matter for a good laugh; and yet the story is
    not without a touch of pathos, as it is impossible not to pity
    the steady, prim, old-fashioned jog-trot NOBODY, whose son, but
    just one remove above a regular 'ARRY, treats him with such
    unfilial rudeness.</p>

    <p>It has been complained that the late General Election has
    not been amusing, and has given birth to little fun. Let those
    who feel this most acutely read Mr. R.C. LEHMANN's <i>The
    "Billsbury Election (Leaves from the Diary of a
    Candidate)."</i> He will tell you how Mr. RICHARD B. PATTLE
    contested Billsbury in the Constitutional Interest; how he
    "buttered up Billsbury like fun," was badgered by Billsbury,
    heckled by Billsbury, taxed, tithed and tormented by Billsbury,
    and eventually "chucked" by Billsbury, by the aggravatingly
    small majority of seventeen. Also how his "Mother bore up like
    a Trojan, and said she was prouder of me than ever." Just
    so.</p>

    <h2>JUSTICE FOR 'FRISCO.</h2>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;I notice that a complaint has been
    made that those charming stories of wild life in the Far West,
    are out of date. Nay, more, that they are calculated to do a
    great deal of harm to a considerable amount of valuable
    property. On the other hand, the talented authors of the
    picturesque romances to which I have referred, insist that
    there is a great demand for these literary wares, and they
    would suffer much loss if they were to discontinue their
    production.</p>

    <p>Could not the matter be compromised? We are less sensitive
    than our American cousins, and if the scene were changed from
    St. Francisco to some quiet watering-place on the Kentish
    Coast, our kindred beyond the seas ought to be satisfied. I do
    not pretend to be a master of the style of those who write
    Backwood sensations, but I think I can jot down a few lines to
    show what I mean. Beneath I give a specimen of the sort of
    thing that might take the place of stories revelling in such
    titles as the "<i>Luck of Murder Camp</i>," "<i>Slack Bill's
    Banker</i>," and "<i>The Talk of Stab-in-the-Backman's
    Chasm</i>."</p>

    <h3>THE CHAFF OF HERNE BAY CREEK.</h3>

    <h4>CHAPTER XX.&mdash;<i>Charley Meets a Chum</i>.</h4>

    <p>The Miners who had been digging all day long the rough
    shingle for treasure-trove, had retired to their rudely
    constructed cabins. These rough huts were built of wood, and
    furnished with a seat on either side. There were two small
    windows let into the oaken walls&mdash;each of them not more
    than six inches square. They were absolutely free from
    furniture&mdash;save perhaps, a foot of cheap looking-glass,
    and here and there a wooden-peg used by the Miners for hanging
    up their slouch-hats, their red flannel-shirts, and their long
    leather-boots.</p>

    <p>These huts were not unlike the other habitations in the wild
    Far West, save that they had this peculiarity&mdash;each hut
    was mounted on a huge springless framework, supported by four
    lumbering wooden wheels. By this arrangement the hut could be
    moved from place to place, sometimes to the fields, with their
    mines of undiscovered treasure; sometimes to the sea, burdened
    with legacies of the mighty deep.</p>

    <p>CHARLEY was smoking a pipe, and thinking of that fair home
    in San Francisco, the very centre of civilisation, where the
    hotels were admirable, the stores well stocked, and house
    property at a premium.</p>

    <p>"I did not discover a single ruby yesterday," he murmured,
    and then he looked at the wooden spade of a child&mdash;"I
    found only there a young 'un's toy. But it has softened my
    heart, and taught me that human nature is human nature."</p>

    <p>He paused to wipe away with a sunburnt hand a furtive
    tear.</p>

    <p>"CHARLEY, my lad," he exclaimed, "this is unmanly. What
    would DARE DEATH DICK or THUNDER TIM say to such a show of
    water?"</p>

    <p>He took the spade, and was about to throw it with violence
    to the ground, when his better nature triumphed, and he placed
    it, almost with reverence, on the bench beside him.</p>

    <p>He was disturbed by a tap on the outer door&mdash;the door
    that faced the sea.</p>

    <p>"Who's there?" he shouted, as he held in one hand a
    revolver, and in the other a bowie-knife of the usual
    fashion.</p>

    <p>"Are you ready?"</p>

    <p>It was a gruff voice, and yet there was something feminine
    about it. CHARLEY had never feared to meet a woman yet, and he
    did not now shrink from the encounter. However his training had
    made him cautious. It might be a trap of the bloodthirsty
    Indians&mdash;those Children of Nature who were known to
    indulge in any cruel subterfuge to secure the white men as
    their prey.</p>

    <p>"Are you ready?" was repeated in the same gruff voice, but
    now the tone was one of entreaty. The speaker seemed to be
    imploring for a reply.</p>

    <p>CHARLEY hesitated no longer. He put down the bowie-knife,
    and still holding the revolver, opened the door.</p>

    <p>He started back! Yes, it was a woman who confronted him. But
    such a woman! Her face was weather-beaten and sunburnt. Her
    hair was grey, and there were pieces of sea-weed in the
    shapeless mass that once may have been called a bonnet. She was
    wearing a heavy serge dress that was dripping with the sea. On
    her huge feet were old boots sodden with sand and wet. She
    might have been of any age, from fifty upwards.</p>

    <p>She gazed at CHARLEY with an uncanny smile, and extended her
    arms towards him. Then she spoke in the same gruff tone,</p>

    <p>"Come to your MARTHA!"</p>

    <p>And CHARLEY knew he had met a chum!</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There, something like the above might do. The woods in the
    neighbourhood of Herne Bay are just the places for adventure,
    and, with thought, a good deal might be managed with the
    Reculvers.</p>

    <p>And now, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, I have done.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours respectfully,<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
